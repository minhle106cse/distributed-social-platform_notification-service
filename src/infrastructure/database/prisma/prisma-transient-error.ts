/**
 * Infra-layer predicate that classifies Prisma errors as transient (retryable).
 * Injected into RetryMiddleware so the middleware itself stays ORM-agnostic.
 *
 * Only P2034 (write conflict / deadlock) is retried: the losing transaction is
 * aborted by Postgres and typically resolves within milliseconds — retry here is
 * the standard, low-risk remediation (Prisma docs recommend it).
 *
 * P2028 (transaction/connection API error) is DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED (2026-07-14,
 * resilience_patterns.md §3) — it can signal connection-pool exhaustion, not a
 * momentary blip. Auto-retrying it re-requests a connection from the SAME
 * exhausted pool: a retry-storm antipattern that adds load during the exact
 * window the pool needs it to drain, potentially prolonging the outage instead
 * of recovering from it. Letting it fail fast surfaces a real 5xx to the client
 * instead of silently compounding pressure server-side. See prisma-metrics for
 * observed frequency before reconsidering.
